The project has been due to the relatively small number of developers in domestic use, such as a developer to use it to display real-time surveillance video camera.

Waring: the player has just started, the current function is relatively simple, it is able to playback videos. Also several currently known bug: when the zoom window crashes often, frequently seek sometimes crashes, the latter will be repaired.

Since c / c ++ development using, so the player's goal is cross-platform, supports various mainstream operating platform!
